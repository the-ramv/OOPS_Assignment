# 💻 C++ OOPS & Programming Concepts – Class Assignments

This repository contains a collection of **C++ programs** created as part of my **class assignments**.  
Each program demonstrates key concepts in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Core C++ Programming** such as arrays, loops, functions, conditionals, and more.

## 📁 Folder Overview

The repository includes both **program files (.cpp)** and their corresponding **output files** (saved program outputs).  
Below is an overview of all the topics covered.

| Category  | Program / Output Files | Concept Demonstrated  |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| 🧮 Arrays | `1Darray.cpp`, `2Darray.cpp` + outputs | Single & Multi-dimensional Arrays |
| 🔢 Numbers | `2digit output`, `3digit output`, `4num output` | Basic numeric operations |
| 🔁 Loops | `for output`, `while output`, `dowhile output` | Control flow using loops |
| 🧠 Conditionals | `oddeven output`, `switch output`, `threemax output`, `threemin output`, `fourmax output`, `twomax output` | If-Else & Switch statements |
| 🧰 Functions | `functions output` | Creating and using functions |
| 🎯 Pointers | `Pointers output` | Pointer basics & memory referencing |
| 🔡 Strings | `string output` | String handling and manipulation |

## 🧩 Concepts Practiced

This assignment set covers:

- **Basic Syntax & Input/Output**
- **Control Structures** (`if`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- **Arrays (1D & 2D)**
- **Functions & Scope**
- **Pointers**
- **Strings**
- **Decision Making & Comparisons**
- **Understanding Outputs and Debugging**

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, I learned to:
- Apply object-oriented thinking in basic C++ code
- Use arrays and loops effectively
- Write modular and reusable code with functions
- Manipulate data using pointers and strings
- Predict and verify program outputs

## 🚀 How to Run the Programs

### Option 1: Using g++ in Terminal
```bash
# Compile
g++ filename.cpp -o output

# Run
./output   # (Mac/Linux)
output.exe # (Windows)
